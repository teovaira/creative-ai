## Objective
Prepare the environment for work by installing Python and creating a Hello World program.

## Steps Completed

### 1. Python Installation Verification

- Result: Python 3.12.3 is installed and working
- This meets the requirement of Python 3.9+ 

### 2. Virtual Environment Setup
- Created virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`
- Activated virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`
- Verified virtual environment is working correctly

### 3. Project Configuration
