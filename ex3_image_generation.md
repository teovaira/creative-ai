# Exercise 3: Image Generation Prompt Design

**Objective:** Create prompts for models that generate images.

## Vague Prompt
"A futuristic city skyline at sunset in watercolor style."

**Model Output:** 
Generated a basic cityscape with tall buildings silhouetted against an orange sky. The watercolor effect was minimal, showing simple color washes without detailed texture. Buildings lacked distinctive futuristic features and appeared generic.

## Refined Prompt
"A sprawling futuristic metropolis with towering glass spires and floating platforms, bathed in warm golden sunset light reflecting off crystalline surfaces, rendered in soft watercolor technique with vibrant orange and purple sky gradients, viewed from elevated perspective showing depth and atmospheric haze, featuring sleek architectural curves and glowing neon accents in cool blue tones."

**Model Output:**
Produced a detailed cityscape with distinctive glass towers and floating elements. The watercolor technique showed proper color bleeding and texture. Sky displayed clear orange-to-purple gradient. Architectural details included curved surfaces and visible neon lighting effects. Perspective created depth with atmospheric haze between building layers.

## Comparison
The vague prompt resulted in a generic image lacking specific details. The refined prompt produced a more detailed, visually coherent result with better artistic execution and clearer adherence to the requested style and elements.
